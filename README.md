In the days where Survivor is unfortunately not on our televisions, with my recent learning of Python coding and a twist idea I heard from a friend years ago, I created a Survivor simulator with the twist called Survivor: Two Worlds. Basically, two seasons in one season where castaways play their season and once the "merge" hits, they find out about the other season going on and the two seasons merge into one big Survivor season. I've also added a few twists that I've come up during my time making some Survivor codes, so I hope you enjoy my creation (with inspiration from another Survivor Fantasy code I saw on Reddit years ago and got inspired by: https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/3autni/survivor_fantasy_program_a_program_that_lets_you/
A few notes since the code isn't perfect, be precise with your spelling when using the code, especially with names. For instance, if you wrote one name being a castaway named Jonny
and you want Jonny to enter the Survivor Casino, when it asks you for his name, write Jonny just like that. writing it like jonny will mess things up. Same with yes or no questions,
type yes as yes and no as no. Writing it as Yes or YES or No or NO will could also mess things up. Enjoy the code!
